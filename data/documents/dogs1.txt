Dogs
Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals that have been human companions for thousands of years. Evolving from wolves, they display incredible diversity in breed, size, shape, and temperament. More than just pets, dogs often serve as working animals, assisting in law enforcement, search and rescue, and providing support as service animals. Their loyalty, intelligence, and capacity for love have solidified their place as beloved members of families worldwide. From the tiny Chihuahua to the giant Great Dane, dogs enrich our lives in countless ways.
